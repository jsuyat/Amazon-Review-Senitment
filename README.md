# Amazon-Review-Senitment
Program that predicts the sentiment of various Amazon products. This repository comes with three files: knn.py, trainhw1.txt
and testdatahw1.txt. The Python program uses the k-nearest-neighbors algorithm to come up with the prediction. The training 
data can be found in trainhw1.txt. It consists of a label (a positive number for a positive review or a negative number for a 
negative review) and text data associated with that label. This will be used in the knn algorithm in order to build the learning
classifier. The Python program then predicts the sentiment of each review found in the testdatahw1.txt.
